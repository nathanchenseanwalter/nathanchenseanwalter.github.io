Have you ever wondered what **fusion** actually looks like?

![Fusion GIF – inside a tokamak](/assets/images/output.gif)

This mesmerizing image was captured using a **visible-light camera** inside a **tokamak**—a magnetic confinement device used in fusion research.

What you're seeing is **plasma** heated to over **100 million degrees Celsius**, nearly **10 times hotter than the core of the Sun**. Despite its intensity, this is a controlled environment made possible by decades of innovation in magnetic fusion technology.

If you're curious about how this works, and how we’re building systems to control it in real-time, head over to the [**Research**](/research/) page.
